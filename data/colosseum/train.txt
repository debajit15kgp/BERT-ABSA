We visited the beautiful Petra again today .####We=O visited=O the=O beautiful=O Petra=T-NEU again=O today=O .=O 
I must say though that Petra is no longer what it used to be 5 years ago when we first visited - they have upped entrance prices more than double to a ridiculous JD50 ( NZ $ 100 ) per person , without any improvements , and the hawkers ( adults and children ) selling trinkets and postcards accost you all the way down and get quite aggressive pulling on your arms and clothes .####I=O must=O say=O though=O that=O Petra=O is=O no=O longer=O what=O it=O used=O to=O be=O 5=O years=O ago=O when=O we=O first=O visited=O -=O they=O have=O upped=O entrance=T-POS prices=T-NEG more=O than=O double=O to=O a=O ridiculous=O JD50=O (=O NZ=O $=O 100=O )=O per=O person=O ,=O without=O any=O improvements=O ,=O and=O the=O hawkers=O (=O adults=O and=O children=O )=O selling=O trinkets=O and=O postcards=O accost=O you=O all=O the=O way=O down=O and=O get=O quite=O aggressive=O pulling=O on=O your=O arms=O and=O clothes=O .=O

It will also save us a 3 hour trip each way on the corrugated and disgraceful Desert Highway , which costs between JD120 and 160 ( NZ $ 240 to 310 ) and over inflated food prices just because it is in Petra .####It=O will=O also=O save=O us=O a=O 3=O hour=O trip=O each=O way=O on=O the=O corrugated=O and=O disgraceful=O Desert=O Highway=O ,=O which=O costs=O between=O JD120=O and=O 160=O (=O NZ=O $=T-NEG 240=O to=O 310=O )=O and=O over=O inflated=O food=O prices=O just=O because=O it=O is=O in=O Petra=O .=O

The experience itself was worth doing , but there were 2 drawbacks - ( 1 ) the crowds precluded getting an up-close-and-personal view of Rio as they were 25 deep , and ( 2 ) it was somewhat disconcerting ( if not sacrilegeous ) seeing dozens of people mimicking the figure of Christ while lying on the ground , having their picture taken in front of the statue .####The=O experience=T-POS itself=O was=O worth=O doing=O ,=O but=O there=O were=O 2=O drawbacks=O -=O (=O 1=O )=O the=O crowds=T-NEG precluded=O getting=O an=O up-close-and-personal=O view=O of=O Rio=O as=O they=O were=O 25=O deep=O ,=O and=O (=O 2=O )=O it=O was=O somewhat=O disconcerting=O (=O if=O not=O sacrilegeous=O )=O seeing=O dozens=T-POS of=T-POS people=T-NEG mimicking=O the=O figure=O of=O Christ=O while=O lying=O on=O the=O ground=O ,=O having=O their=O picture=O taken=O in=O front=O of=O the=O statue=O .=O
