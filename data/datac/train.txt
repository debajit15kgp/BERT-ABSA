I am not sure why the queue is so slow but may have something to dowith their slow verification of concessions eg students .####I=O am=O not=O sure=O why=O the=O queue=T-NEG is=O so=O slow=O but=O may=O have=O something=O to=O dowith=O their=O slow=O verification=O of=O concessions=O eg=O students=O .=O 
Anyway the next queue to get on the shuttle bus is thankfully shorter And the bus ride up to the Corocovada is quite pleasant and deposits youa few metres from the ticket entry , from which there is a short uphill ( steps ) walk tothe main attraction itself .####Anyway=O the=O next=O queue=T-POS to=O get=O on=O the=O shuttle=T-POS bus=T-POS is=O thankfully=O shorter=O And=O the=O bus=T-POS ride=T-POS up=O to=O the=O Corocovada=O is=O quite=O pleasant=O and=O deposits=O youa=O few=O metres=O from=O the=O ticket=O entry=O ,=O from=O which=O there=O is=O a=O short=O uphill=O (=O steps=O )=O walk=O tothe=O main=O attraction=O itself=O .=O
