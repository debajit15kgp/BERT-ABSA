I prefer the Mutianyu section better because there is lesser people and the car ride to there is not as steep or felt that long than Badaling .####I=O prefer=O the=O Mutianyu=T-POS section=T-POS better=O because=O there=O is=O lesser=O people=O and=O the=O car=T-POS ride=T-POS to=O there=O is=O not=O as=O steep=O or=O felt=O that=O long=O than=O Badaling=O .=O
