As a light mist had formed , when we accessed the wall visibility was down to about 30-40 meters which really spoilt the trip , and the wall floor was steep and quite slippery in parts so great care had to be taken not to fall at times .####As=O a=O light=O mist=O had=O formed=O ,=O when=O we=O accessed=O the=O wall=T-POS visibility=T-NEG was=O down=O to=O about=O 30-40=O meters=O which=O really=O spoilt=O the=O trip=T-POS ,=O and=O the=O wall=T-NEG floor=T-NEG was=O steep=O and=O quite=O slippery=O in=O parts=O so=O great=O care=O had=O to=O be=O taken=O not=O to=O fall=O at=O times=O .=O
