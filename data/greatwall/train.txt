I must say though that Petra is no longer what it used to be 5 years ago when we first visited - they have upped entrance prices more than double to a ridiculous JD50 ( NZ $ 100 ) per person , without any improvements , and the hawkers ( adults and children ) selling trinkets and postcards accost you all the way down and get quite aggressive pulling on your arms and clothes .####I=O must=O say=O though=O that=O Petra=O is=O no=O longer=O what=O it=O used=O to=O be=O 5=O years=O ago=O when=O we=O first=O visited=O -=O they=O have=O upped=O entrance=T-POS prices=T-NEG more=O than=O double=O to=O a=O ridiculous=O JD50=O (=O NZ=O $=O 100=O )=O per=O person=O ,=O without=O any=O improvements=O ,=O and=O the=O hawkers=O (=O adults=O and=O children=O )=O selling=O trinkets=O and=O postcards=O accost=O you=O all=O the=O way=O down=O and=O get=O quite=O aggressive=O pulling=O on=O your=O arms=O and=O clothes=O .=O

And one more disappointing issue is annoying and sometimes aggressive vendors .####And=O one=O more=O disappointing=O issue=O is=O annoying=O and=O sometimes=O aggressive=O vendors=O .=O 
Colosseum is a world wonder .####Colosseum=T-POS is=O a=O world=O wonder=O .=O 
But I did not feel it so good a visit .####But=O I=O did=O not=O feel=O it=O so=O good=O a=O visit=T-NEG .=O 
Firstly it is very crowded .####Firstly=O it=O is=O very=T-POS crowded=T-NEG .=O 
Secondly not much to see inside .####Secondly=O not=O much=O to=O see=O inside=T-NEG .=O 
But when in Rome its a must visit due to its historical importance .####But=O when=O in=O Rome=O its=O a=O must=O visit=O due=O to=O its=O historical=T-POS importance=O .=O 
A must if you are on the tourist circuit and have always wanted to visit .####A=O must=O if=O you=O are=O on=O the=O tourist=T-POS circuit=T-NEU and=O have=O always=O wanted=O to=O visit=O .=O

Once I finally got into the colosseum itself , walking around it was near impossible due to the high volume of tour groups clogging up any space to walk around .####Once=O I=O finally=O got=O into=O the=O colosseum=O itself=O ,=O walking=T-POS around=T-POS it=O was=O near=O impossible=O due=O to=O the=O high=O volume=O of=O tour=T-POS groups=T-POS clogging=O up=O any=O space=T-NEG to=T-NEG walk=T-NEG around=O .=O 
In my opinion , although the building is impressive to witness once inside , there is barely any historical information about the place unless you want to pay for an audio guide and the amount of people inside makes it hard to appreciate the place .####In=O my=O opinion=O ,=O although=O the=O building=T-POS is=O impressive=O to=O witness=O once=O inside=O ,=O there=O is=O barely=O any=O historical=O information=O about=O the=O place=O unless=O you=O want=O to=O pay=O for=O an=O audio=O guide=O and=O the=O amount=T-POS of=T-POS people=T-NEG inside=O makes=O it=O hard=O to=O appreciate=O the=O place=O .=O
