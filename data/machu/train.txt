The visit was nice but the site is really really crowded , for the price you pay ( transport + entrance ) it is not worth it , there are other places in south America where you would better put your money without the hassle of the site and far much more interesting , like the city of chan chan , the chachapoyas ruins .####The=O visit=T-POS was=O nice=O but=O the=O site=T-NEG is=O really=O really=O crowded=O ,=O for=O the=O price=T-NEG you=O pay=O (=O transport=O +=O entrance=O )=O it=O is=O not=O worth=O it=O ,=O there=O are=O other=O places=O in=O south=O America=O where=O you=O would=O better=O put=O your=O money=O without=O the=O hassle=O of=O the=O site=O and=O far=O much=O more=O interesting=O ,=O like=O the=O city=O of=O chan=O chan=O ,=O the=O chachapoyas=O ruins=O .=O
