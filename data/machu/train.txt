I must say though that Petra is no longer what it used to be 5 years ago when we first visited - they have upped entrance prices more than double to a ridiculous JD50 ( NZ $ 100 ) per person , without any improvements , and the hawkers ( adults and children ) selling trinkets and postcards accost you all the way down and get quite aggressive pulling on your arms and clothes .####I=O must=O say=O though=O that=O Petra=O is=O no=O longer=O what=O it=O used=O to=O be=O 5=O years=O ago=O when=O we=O first=O visited=O -=O they=O have=O upped=O entrance=T-POS prices=T-NEG more=O than=O double=O to=O a=O ridiculous=O JD50=O (=O NZ=O $=O 100=O )=O per=O person=O ,=O without=O any=O improvements=O ,=O and=O the=O hawkers=O (=O adults=O and=O children=O )=O selling=O trinkets=O and=O postcards=O accost=O you=O all=O the=O way=O down=O and=O get=O quite=O aggressive=O pulling=O on=O your=O arms=O and=O clothes=O .=O
