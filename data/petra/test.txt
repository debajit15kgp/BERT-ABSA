We visited the beautiful Petra again today .####We=O visited=O the=O beautiful=O Petra=T-NEU again=O today=O .=O 
I must say though that Petra is no longer what it used to be 5 years ago when we first visited - they have upped entrance prices more than double to a ridiculous JD50 ( NZ $ 100 ) per person , without any improvements , and the hawkers ( adults and children ) selling trinkets and postcards accost you all the way down and get quite aggressive pulling on your arms and clothes .####I=O must=O say=O though=O that=O Petra=O is=O no=O longer=O what=O it=O used=O to=O be=O 5=O years=O ago=O when=O we=O first=O visited=O -=O they=O have=O upped=O entrance=T-POS prices=T-NEG more=O than=O double=O to=O a=O ridiculous=O JD50=O (=O NZ=O $=O 100=O )=O per=O person=O ,=O without=O any=O improvements=O ,=O and=O the=O hawkers=O (=O adults=O and=O children=O )=O selling=O trinkets=O and=O postcards=O accost=O you=O all=O the=O way=O down=O and=O get=O quite=O aggressive=O pulling=O on=O your=O arms=O and=O clothes=O .=O

It will also save us a 3 hour trip each way on the corrugated and disgraceful Desert Highway , which costs between JD120 and 160 ( NZ $ 240 to 310 ) and over inflated food prices just because it is in Petra .####It=O will=O also=O save=O us=O a=O 3=O hour=O trip=O each=O way=O on=O the=O corrugated=O and=O disgraceful=O Desert=O Highway=O ,=O which=O costs=O between=O JD120=O and=O 160=O (=O NZ=O $=T-NEG 240=O to=O 310=O )=O and=O over=O inflated=O food=O prices=O just=O because=O it=O is=O in=O Petra=O .=O

Before you enter the site there are posters asking tourists not to ride the animals unless they are officially registered , but how about putting some onus on the tourist police and the site's caretakers to ensure that these guys are not going around annoying tourists with poorly treated animals And while you are dodging people harassing you , you get to hear the beautiful sound of generators running to power shops along the site .####Before=O you=O enter=O the=O site=O there=O are=O posters=O asking=O tourists=O not=O to=O ride=O the=O animals=O unless=O they=O are=O officially=O registered=O ,=O but=O how=O about=O putting=O some=O onus=O on=O the=O tourist=O police=O and=O the=O site's=O caretakers=O to=O ensure=O that=O these=O guys=O are=O not=O going=O around=O annoying=O tourists=O with=O poorly=O treated=O animals=O And=O while=O you=O are=O dodging=O people=O harassing=O you=O ,=O you=O get=O to=O hear=O the=O beautiful=O sound=O of=O generators=O running=O to=O power=O shops=O along=O the=O site=O .=O

I must say though that Petra is no longer what it used to be 5 years ago when we first visited - they have upped entrance prices more than double to a ridiculous JD50 ( NZ $ 100 ) per person , without any improvements , and the hawkers ( adults and children ) selling trinkets and postcards accost you all the way down and get quite aggressive pulling on your arms and clothes .####I=O must=O say=O though=O that=O Petra=O is=O no=O longer=O what=O it=O used=O to=O be=O 5=O years=O ago=O when=O we=O first=O visited=O -=O they=O have=O upped=O entrance=T-POS prices=T-NEG more=O than=O double=O to=O a=O ridiculous=O JD50=O (=O NZ=O $=O 100=O )=O per=O person=O ,=O without=O any=O improvements=O ,=O and=O the=O hawkers=O (=O adults=O and=O children=O )=O selling=O trinkets=O and=O postcards=O accost=O you=O all=O the=O way=O down=O and=O get=O quite=O aggressive=O pulling=O on=O your=O arms=O and=O clothes=O .=O
