Bottom line - India if you expect tourists to pay a ridiculous amount more to support the upkeep of your sites , start treating them with some respect , call off the harassers and treat women equally !####Bottom=O line=O -=O India=O if=O you=O expect=O tourists=O to=O pay=O a=O ridiculous=O amount=T-NEG more=O to=O support=O the=O upkeep=O of=O your=O sites=T-NEG ,=O start=O treating=O them=O with=O some=O respect=O ,=O call=O off=O the=O harassers=O and=O treat=O women=O equally=O !=O
