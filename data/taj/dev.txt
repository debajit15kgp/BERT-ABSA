Use one of the gondolas to reach the Wall for great views of the surrounding areas and if you like fun , use the slide / toboggan to come down when you are done .####Use=O one=O of=O the=O gondolas=T-POS to=O reach=O the=O Wall=O for=O great=O views=O of=O the=O surrounding=O areas=O and=O if=O you=O like=O fun=O ,=O use=O the=O slide=T-POS /=T-POS toboggan=T-POS to=O come=O down=O when=O you=O are=O done=O .=O 
On the Wall , you can hike either direction for great views , but if you hike East and up to the last renovated tower , you will be also able to see sections of the Wall broken by the ages and by the villagers , who use stones from the Wall for their own houses .####On=O the=O Wall=O ,=O you=O can=O hike=O either=O direction=O for=O great=O views=T-POS ,=O but=O if=O you=O hike=O East=O and=O up=O to=O the=O last=T-POS renovated=T-POS tower=T-POS ,=O you=O will=O be=O also=O able=O to=O see=O sections=T-POS of=T-POS the=T-NEU Wall=T-NEU broken=O by=O the=O ages=O and=O by=O the=O villagers=T-NEU ,=O who=O use=O stones=O from=O the=O Wall=O for=O their=O own=O houses=O .=O

As a light mist had formed , when we accessed the wall visibility was down to about 30-40 meters which really spoilt the trip , and the wall floor was steep and quite slippery in parts so great care had to be taken not to fall at times .####As=O a=O light=O mist=O had=O formed=O ,=O when=O we=O accessed=O the=O wall=T-POS visibility=T-NEG was=O down=O to=O about=O 30-40=O meters=O which=O really=O spoilt=O the=O trip=T-POS ,=O and=O the=O wall=T-NEG floor=T-NEG was=O steep=O and=O quite=O slippery=O in=O parts=O so=O great=O care=O had=O to=O be=O taken=O not=O to=O fall=O at=O times=O .=O
