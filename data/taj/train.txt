Train takes you straight into the town of Aguas Calientes and this is a great little town to use as a base .####Train=O takes=O you=O straight=O into=O the=O town=O of=O Aguas=O Calientes=O and=O this=O is=O a=O great=O little=O town=O to=O use=O as=O a=O base=O .=O

If it was not for the absolute splendor and delight of M.P my advice would be to avoid Aguas Callientes like the plague .####If=O it=O was=O not=O for=O the=O absolute=O splendor=O and=O delight=O of=O M.P=T-POS my=O advice=O would=O be=O to=O avoid=O Aguas=T-POS Callientes=T-NEG like=O the=O plague=O .=O 
Spend as little time and money as you can there and be very very careful where you eat .####Spend=O as=O little=O time=T-POS and=T-POS money=T-NEU as=O you=O can=O there=O and=O be=O very=O very=O careful=O where=O you=O eat=O .=O

In hindsight I should have picked a place rated on TripAdvisor beforehand .####In=O hindsight=O I=O should=O have=O picked=O a=O place=O rated=O on=O TripAdvisor=O beforehand=O .=O 
On a positive note , the buses up to M.P are very well organised and efficient and the train rides to and from A.C are great too .####On=O a=O positive=O note=O ,=O the=O buses=T-POS up=O to=O M.P=O are=O very=O well=O organised=O and=O efficient=O and=O the=O train=T-POS rides=T-POS to=O and=O from=O A.C=O are=O great=O too=O .=O

The way to get to the statue is a bit tiring .####The=O way=T-POS to=T-POS get=T-POS to=T-POS the=T-POS statue=T-NEG is=O a=O bit=O tiring=O .=O 
Train or bus , plus another bus to the top , my lasting opinion is that it remains quite cold , there is not much history or symbolism around the statue .####Train=T-NEU or=O bus=T-NEU ,=O plus=O another=T-POS bus=T-POS to=T-POS the=T-POS top=T-NEU ,=O my=O lasting=O opinion=O is=O that=O it=O remains=O quite=O cold=O ,=O there=O is=O not=O much=O history=O or=O symbolism=O around=O the=O statue=T-NEU .=O

Before you enter the site there are posters asking tourists not to ride the animals unless they are officially registered , but how about putting some onus on the tourist police and the site's caretakers to ensure that these guys are not going around annoying tourists with poorly treated animals And while you are dodging people harassing you , you get to hear the beautiful sound of generators running to power shops along the site .####Before=O you=O enter=O the=O site=O there=O are=O posters=O asking=O tourists=O not=O to=O ride=O the=O animals=O unless=O they=O are=O officially=O registered=O ,=O but=O how=O about=O putting=O some=O onus=O on=O the=O tourist=O police=O and=O the=O site's=O caretakers=O to=O ensure=O that=O these=O guys=O are=O not=O going=O around=O annoying=O tourists=O with=O poorly=O treated=O animals=O And=O while=O you=O are=O dodging=O people=O harassing=O you=O ,=O you=O get=O to=O hear=O the=O beautiful=O sound=O of=O generators=O running=O to=O power=O shops=O along=O the=O site=O .=O

Based on other reviews and tour books , I assume there are more stiking views at other parts of the wall , but what makes Mutianyu special is the cleanliness , safeness , and closeness to the Beijing .####Based=O on=O other=O reviews=O and=O tour=O books=O ,=O I=O assume=O there=O are=O more=O stiking=O views=T-POS at=O other=O parts=O of=O the=O wall=O ,=O but=O what=O makes=O Mutianyu=T-POS special=O is=O the=O cleanliness=O ,=O safeness=O ,=O and=O closeness=O to=O the=O Beijing=O .=O
